#AntiToxicity

Current version: 1.0

You are welcome to use any of this code without credit. (I'd like credit, but it's optional)

This mod has the capability of blocking any message that matches a user inputted regular expression.

you can also optionally add a message that you can then hover over to see the original message was blocked

you can also add exceptions, for messages that will not be blocked. 
By default, messages in party chat and guild chat will not be blocked.
There is also an exception added for the user's username.



Also I wrote this entire mod in one file because I hate you
